This repository contains 2 separate projects:  a Recurring Neural Network (RNN) project and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) project.  
The RNN project can be found in the folder biaxial-rnn-music-composition-master.  The RNN model is a music composition project.  
The CNN project is a single file called CNNmain.py.  In this project, we use layers to build a convolutional neural network model that can recognize the handwritten digits in the MNIST data set.  

Team members include:  Kasra Khademorezaiank, Akhil Gudivada, Trina K. Locklear and Babak M. Shoja

Please note that all the project is being done through several meetings with all group members and all group mates contributed in every part of the project.
