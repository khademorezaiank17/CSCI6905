This repository contains 2 separate projects. The RNN project can be found in the folder biaxial-rnn-music-composition-master.
The RNN model is a music composition project.  The CNN project is a single file called CNNmain.py.  In this project, we use 
layers to build a convolutional neural network model that can recognize the handwritten digitsin the MNIST data set.
